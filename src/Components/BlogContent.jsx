        Body: "Today I ran into a somewhat interesting problem…When I first created my React App, the default page was showing just fine. Then I decided to get to work on my project and then… all I got was this blank page…I was looking in the wrong place, from the beginning I thought it was a configuration problem, because that’s what usually happens when you have a server running and you see nothing.But it was a programming problem. The reason this error “snuck” through is because JavaScript is an interpreted language. In a compiled language, errors like this would have been picked up by a compiler. The editor I’m using (Atom) also didn’t notify me of the error. I may take a look at JavaScript Linters in the future to see if it addresses this problem.",
